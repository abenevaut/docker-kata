Get started with Docker through exercises.

## Objectives

- understand the basics of Docker for local development
- understand and practice image and container management
  - execute binaries
  - run services
- learn and practice basic volume and network management

## Prerequisite

- you must have [Docker desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) installed on your machine
- we will be working with Linux containers; a basic understanding of an operating system (OS) may be necessary

ℹ️ Note: All exercises are demonstrated on Windows using Visual Studio 2022, but they are not specific to this environment.

## Exercises

Each directory contains an exercise to complete:
- the `readme.md` file contains the exercise description
- the `readme.md` file contains the solution
- other files in the directory illustrate the build context for a binary or service that needs to run in a container
