# FROM scratch

This exercise is designed to mount a volume to persist data in a Docker service with [the azure sql edge](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/azure-sql-edge) image. 

## Subject

Azure sql edge is a cloud-based relational database service.

## Exercise

Pull and run the Azure sql edge image twice as a background service.

- The first service should persist data in a docker volume.
- The second service should persist data in a mounted directory from the host.

Inspirate from the [docker run doc.](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/), the [azure sql edge image doc.](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/azure-sql-edge) and the [starter-kit](../000-starter-kit/README.md) if needed.
