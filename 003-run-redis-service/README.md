# Are you Redis ?

This exercise is designed to create and use our first Docker service with [the Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/) image.

## Subject

As we have already seen, docker provides a way to create isolated environments that can be used to run services the same way on different machines.

On Docker Hub, you can find a multitude of images that can be used to run services.
Redis is one of them and a popular in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker.

To re-use existing services, you can use images from the Docker Hub, like we will do with the Redis image.
Images are pre-built packages that contain everything needed to run a service, including the application code, dependencies, and configuration.

When you run a container from an image, you create an instance of the service defined by the image.
This instance is isolated from other containers and can be accessed through ports that you expose on the host machine.

To get an image, you can use the `docker pull` command.
To run a container from an image, you can use the `docker run` command.

## Exercise

Here we go, you have to run and connect to your own Redis server using Docker.
- [Redis image](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis)

Pull and run the Redis image as a background service, running on port 1337.
We will focus the cache usage of Redis, as a key-value store; This is the basic usage of Redis image, so no more options are needed.

Get inspired from the [docker run doc.](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/), the [Redis image doc.](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/) and the [starter-kit](../000-starter-kit/README.md) if needed.

  <summary>Solution</summary>

This command executes a Docker container to compile a C program dynamically using GCC within an isolated environment.

```shell
docker run -d -p 1337:6379 --name my-redis redis:latest
```

Explanation of options:
- `--name my-redis`: Assigns a name to the container to make it easier to identify. Here, the container is named "my-redis".
- `-d`: Runs the container in the background (detached mode).
- `-p 1337:6379`: Maps port 6379 of the container to port 1337 of the host. This allows applications on the host to access Redis in the container using port 1337.

ðŸ’¯ Congratulations! You have run a Redis server using Docker ðŸŽ‰
